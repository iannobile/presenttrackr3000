# PresentTrakr3000
"8 meters! 6 six meters! 5 meters man, it's reading right in the room!"

## Description
The easiest way to track your presents, PresentTrakr3000 is an Android application that allows you to mark the location of presents (not aliens) on a map and then navigate to them.
Each step taken plays a ping sound, and when the present (again, not alien) is located and selected on the map it plays a tune and removes the present from the map.

## Notes:
* Optimized for Nexus 7 2013 version in landscape mode.
* When prompted, You'll need to enable the following permissions:

* Replace the google_maps_key in values/google_maps_api.xml with your own Google Maps API key.
